LocalDrafts
===========

LocalDrafts is a plugin for Vanilla that replaces the autosave draft feature. The plugin uses HTML5 local storage feature that modern browsers offer.
The difference to the standard "Drafts" feature are as follows:

LocalDrafts Contra

- Works only with "modern" browsers that support localStorage
- Only category, title and text are tracked
- drafts are stored locally, so you can only use them on the same browser

LocalDrafts Pro
+ Stores on local Harddisk => fast!
+ Draft is saved on each keypress


Vanilla Drafts Pro
+ Keeps track of every form field
+ Works with any browser
+ available per user, thus cross browser/pc

Vanilla Drafts Contra
- Drafts are saved in intervals
- Transfers data from client to server, stores on db
